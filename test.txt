#Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its,formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords ^where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other`languages, it<>does not use curly &*brackets //to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[77]
