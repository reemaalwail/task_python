   ? Founded by Amancio Ortega in 1975, Zara is a flagship clothing chain store 
  that is part of Inditex group, the world's largest apparel retailer. 
  Amancio Ortega opened the first Zara store in 1975 in central A Coru√±a,
   Galicia, Spain where the company is still based. Ortega initially named the store Zorba 
   after the classic film Zorba the Greek, but after learning there was a bar with 
   the same name two blocks away, the letters were remolded for the sign to say "Zara". 
   It is believed the extra "a" came from an additional set of letters that had been made for
    the company.[8][9] The first store featured low-priced lookalike products of popular, 
    higher-end clothing fashions. Ortega opened additional stores throughout Spain.
     During the 1980s, Ortega changed the design, manufacturing, and distribution 
     process to reduce lead times and react to new trends in a quicker way, which he called 
     "instant fashions". The improvements included the use of information technology and groups
      of designers instead of individuals.
